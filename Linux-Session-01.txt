Phase-01-Introduction to Linux vs Enterprise Linux 

Linux Session
 - What is Linux ?
   It's an Operating System (Eng Like - Windows/Mac/etc).

 - What is Operating System (w.r.t Computer --> Server)?
   Operating System is a software, which manage hardware.
   Operating system used for optimum or maximum utilization of hardware (Where it is installed).   
   
 - Operating System (Types of OS)?
    Unix 
	Linux 
	Window 
	Mac 

 - What is Server ?
   Who serve the service (Service over WEB - via http/https etc).
   
   Eg:-
   When Enterprise Linux, installed on IBM/Dell/HP/Cisco hardware(Server)
   Hardware(Server) - Standalone server or Blade server, etc.
	
	- Enterprise Linux (RHEL) installed on IBM blade server.
	- Then deploy banking/Madical/etc domain applications on it.
	- Now it serve the mentioned service.
	
 - Components of Operating System.
   1.Users (Admin User = root, Normal user = john , System User = apache)
     You can login as root or normal user.
	 And normal user can also have admin acces via "sudo".
	 Any command execution (if you place sudo before that, it mean it will execute as Admin/eoor account).
	 
	 
   2.Interface (GUI or CLI).
     Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - GUI part -  GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment).
	 Enterprise Linux (RHEK) - CLI part -  bash, sh, ksh, tcsh 
   
   
   3.Kernel (Core of OS)   
     

 - Multiple Linux Distrubution.
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
  Fedora 
  CentOS 
  Suse Enterprise Linux 
  Amazone Linux 
  etc 
  
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Multiple versions are running in production.
  RHEL6
  RHEL7
  RHEL8 
  RHEL9

Phase-02 - Introduction to Basic Linux COmmands and Directory Structure.


 Basic commands
 
 $ pwd
 $ whoami 
 $ date 
 $ uptime 
 $ cal 
 
 $ which <command>
 Eg:
 $ which pwd
 /usr/bin/pwd 
 
 $ which whoami 
 /usr/bin/whoami 
 Called absolute path of the command.
 
 
- Users explaination 
1) Admin user (root), #
2) NOrmal user (john), $
3) System user (apache) , unable to login to system.
 
 
 The file-system Hierarchy 
 Level 1st   - root "/" - Directory (folder).

 /bin - All commands, used by normal user are placed in "/bin" 
 /sbin - Admin users commands 
 
 #which pwd
 /usr/bin/pwd 
 
 # which useradd 
 /usr/sbin/useradd 
 
 "/usr" 
 
===================#################################
 Login to your cloud lab.
 Cridentials given to you.
 root/Admin@123 
 
 
 Login as root.
 Note: If you have login as some other user like (server) then logint o root using below methond.
 $ whoami 
 $ su - root 
 password: Admin@123
 # whoami 
 root 
 
 Now create user as per below.
 
 # useradd user1 
 # password user1 

Note: Keep the password same for all users - "Admin@123"

Now move to user1 and verify the account.

 # su - user1 

 $ whoami 
 $ useradd user2 
 Permission denied (it mean only "root" user can create users using useradd command).

 NOte: useradd command belongs to the location - /usr/sbin/useradd 
 ===================###################
 "/" - root directory 
   - bin  or  (/bin) 
   - /usr/bin 
   
   - sbin or  (/sbin)
   - /usr/sbin 
   
   1. "/bin" 
   2. "/sbin"  
   3. "/usr"  ("/usr/bin" & "/usr/sbin").
   
   
   Eg: $ which pwd  (outcome is default)
      /usr/bin/pwd   or /bin/pwd 
	  
	  
	4. "/boot" - Boot related files (Grub, initramfs and Linux Kernel files).
	5. "/dev" - all Device file placed here.
	   eg:
	      Disk - /dev/vda , /dev/vdb , /dev/vdc
	6. "/etc"  - All services configuration files.
	7. "/home" user's home directory by default
	8. "/root" - home dir for "root" user - Admin user.
	9. "/run" - Run time data will be saved/placed in this directory 
	10. "/tmp" - all application use /tmp for deployment/function well.
	11. "/var" - Variable data - 
	
======================
 - Absolute path  - It always start with "/"
 - Relative path  - It always not start with "/" 
 
 # touch (it will create emptly file).
 Eg: 
  # touch file1.txt 
  # touch file2.txt file3.txt 
 
 
 # mkdir (it will create directory/folder)
 Eg:
  # mkdir dir1 
  # mkdir dir2 dir3 dir4 
 
  # cd (change Directory)
  # cd /dirn_name  (it will take you inside "/dirn_name" 
  # pwd 
  /dirn_name
  # cd .. (come out from one dir/folder from your current dir)
  # cd ../.. (come out 2 steps back from your current working dir).
  
  # mkdir /BE
  # cd /BE
  #pwd
  /BE
  # mkdir CSE IT ECE ME 
  # cd CSE 
  pwd
  /BE/CSE 
  # mkdir 1st-year 2nd-year 3rd-year 4th-year 
  # ls -l 
  You will get detail about all directories/folders 
  #pwd
  /BE/CSE
  #cd ..
  #pwd
  /BE
  #cd IT
  #pwd
  /BE/IT 
  
  Repete this and get the output 
 =======================================
 2nd Lab 

Phase-01 

 # mkdir /Project 
 # cd /Project 
 # pwd
 /Project 
 # mkdir dir1 
 # touch file1 
 # ls 
 dir1 file1 
 # ls -l 
 -rw-r--r--  root root skjdfhsdkj   file1 
 drwxr-xr-x  root root sdkfjlsdkk   dir1 
 
 
Phase-02 
 # tree /Project  
 # cp file1 dir1 
 # tree /Project 
 
Phase-03 

 # mkdir dir2 
 # cp dir1 dir2     (COpy dir1 to dir2 will not work).
 NOte: It will show you error 
 # tree /Project 
 
 == Command concepts 
 # Command Option Arguments 
 
 What is Command ("/bin or /usr/bin" and "/sbin or /usr/sbin" and "/usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin").
 Command is utility, used for to perform some action.
 
 What is an Option?
 Option is used for to modify the behavious of the command 
 
 What is an Arguments?
  Arguments is the data needed or required to execute the command.
 
  # mkdir /Project 
  # cd /Porject 
  # pwd
  /Project 
  # ls -l        
  # mkdir dir1 
  # touch file1 
  # cp file1 dir1 
  
  # mkdir dir2 
  # cp dir1 dir2 
  
  # cp -r dir1 dir2 
  
  cp - COmmand 
  -r - Option 
  dir1 - 1st argument
  dir2 - 2nd argument 
 =========================================
 # mkdir -p /ORG/{IT,HR,Sales}/{dep-01,dep02}
 # cd /ORG 
 # touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
 
 Now copy using Absolute path 
 - file1.txt to dep02 of IT 
 - file2.txt to dep01 of HR
 - file3.txt to dep02 of Sales 
 
 # touch file4.txt file5.txt file6.txt
  Now copy using Relative path 
  
  cd /ORG/HR/dep02 then copy below task.
 - file4.txt to dep02 of IT 
 
 cd /ORG/IT/dep01 then copy below task.
 - file5.txt to dep01 of HR
 
 cd /ORG/HR/dep01 then copy below task.
 - file6.txt to dep02 of Sales 
 
 =================================================
 copy - cp command 
 cut  - mv command  (move)
 rm - remove file/directories/folders
 tree - check the tree structure 

 
 
 rm -rf / BE   (Big mistake - Result - OS crashed, very hard to recover).
 
 rm - command 
 
 -r - option 1st (recursive delete)
 -f - option 2nd (forcefully - this option will not ask - Are you sure ?)
 
 "/"    - 1st argument 
 "BE"   - 2nd argument 
 
 Note: ** 
  1st Argument is valid "/" 
  2nd argument is invalid "BE"   (BE you have created in "/" so location of BE is "/BE").
  
  
==========================================
 To create file using text editor (vim).

# vim /BE/file1.txt     (Give "Enter")
Now press "i" key - for insert mode     - Your action 

Now type anything you want
This is my 2nd line 
This is my 3rd line 
  
Once you have done
Now press "esc" key - for lock mode enabled  - Your action 
Then type below instruction.

:wq  - Write and quit    
or    
:w  - Only write 
or
q   - Only quit with save 
or
wq! - Write and quit forcefully.

To see the contents of the file "/BE/file1.txt" use cat command.



#cat /BE/file1.txt
