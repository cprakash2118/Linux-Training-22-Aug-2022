Phase-01-Introduction to Linux vs Enterprise Linux 

Linux Session
 - What is Linux ?
   It's an Operating System (Eng Like - Windows/Mac/etc).

 - What is Operating System (w.r.t Computer --> Server)?

   Eg:-
   When Enterprise Linux, installed on IBM/Dell/HP/Cisco hardware(Server)
   Hardware(Server) - Standalone server or Blade server, etc.
	
	- Enterprise Linux (RHEL) installed on IBM blade server.
	- Then deploy banking/Madical/etc domain applications on it.
	- Now it serve the mentioned service.
	
 - Components of Operating System.
   1.Users (Admin User = root, Normal user = john , System User = apache)
     You can login as root or normal user.
	 And normal user can also have admin acces via "sudo".
	 Any command execution (if you place sudo before that, it mean it will execute as Admin/eoor account).
	 
	 
   2.Interface (GUI or CLI).
     Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - GUI part -  GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment).
	 Enterprise Linux (RHEK) - CLI part -  bash, sh, ksh, tcsh 
   
   
   3.Kernel (Core of OS)   
     

 - Multiple Linux Distrubution.
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
  Fedora 
  CentOS 
  Suse Enterprise Linux 
  Amazone Linux 
  etc 
  
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Multiple versions are running in production.
  RHEL6
  RHEL7
  RHEL8

Phase-02 - Introduction to Basic Linux COmmands and Directory Structure.


 Basic commands
 
 $ pwd
 $ whoami 
 $ date 
 $ uptime 
 $ cal 
 
 $ which <command>
 Eg:
 $ which pwd
 /usr/bin/pwd 
 
 $ which whoami 
 /usr/bin/whoami 
 Called absolute path of the command.
 
 
- Users explaination 
1) Admin user (root), #
2) NOrmal user (john), $
3) System user (apache) , unable to login to system.
 
 
 The file-system Hierarchy 
 Level 1st   - root "/" - Directory (folder).

 /bin - All commands, used by normal user are placed in "/bin" 
 /sbin - Admin users commands 
 
 #which pwd
 /usr/bin/pwd 
 
 # which useradd 
 /usr/sbin/useradd 
 
 "/usr" 
 
===================#################################
 Login to your cloud lab.
 Cridentials given to you.
 root/Admin@123 
 
 
 Login as root.
 Note: If you have login as some other user like (server) then logint o root using below methond.
 $ whoami 
 $ su - root 
 password: Admin@123
 # whoami 
 root 
 
 Now create user as per below.
 
 # useradd user1 
 # password user1 

Note: Keep the password same for all users - "Admin@123"

Now move to user1 and verify the account.

 # su - user1 

 $ whoami 
 $ useradd user2 
 Permission denied (it mean only "root" user can create users using useradd command).

 NOte: useradd command belongs to the location - /usr/sbin/useradd
