- Disk/File-System Management.

#Resources:-
  CPU
  Memeory 
  IO devices (Disk/Storage part).

# Listing disk on server.
Old/Lagacy interface to manage disk on your servers - /usr/sbin/fdisk or /usr/sbin/gdisk etc 
New interface to manage disk on your servers - /usr/sbin/parted 
Basic commands for storage.
# lsblk  or lsblk -fp
# blkid <device_name_path> 
  Eg:- blkid /dev/sda1 
  
# parted print /dev/sda 


# Parttition, File System. and persistent mount points.
 As per parttition schemes:-
1) MBR parttition schemes.
2) GPT per parttition schemes.


1) MBR partition schemes:- 
 Point-1.  As per MBR partition schemes maximum primary partitions can be create is 4.
 Note: After 4 primary partitions, no partition can be created.
 
 POint-2. As per point1 - if less than 4 (3 Primary & 1 Extended partition and Under extended partition only you can create Logical partition).
 
 Point-3. Maximim  partitions can be 15.
          3 - Primary partitions 
		  1 - Extended parttion (All the remaining/required storage can be used by extended partition, so that when extended partiton create then under that logical partitions created and partitions count can be reached upto 15th.
		  
  Point-4. MBR support maximum partition size is 2TiB

  Point-5. 1st 512 bytes for MBR called boot loader (GRub2).
   NOte: GRand Unified Bootload version 2.
   What is bootloader - Boootloader is a source code responsible to start OS.
   
 HOw to manage the partition using parted commands (/usr/sbin/parted).
 
 parted print 
 # parted -l 
 # parted /dev/sdb print  
 # parted /dev/sdb 
 
 
 /dev/sdb (Taking example for this.
 
  # parted /dev/sdb 
  (parted) "print" then press Enter key  
  
Directly creating parttions.
  
  # parted /dev/sdb mklabel msdos   (MBR)
  # parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt     (GPT)
  
  # parted /dev/sdb 
  (parted) "mkpart" then 'Enter' key.
  Partition type? Primary/extended ? "primary" and then 'Enter' key .
  FIle system type? [ext2]
  "print"
  Start? 2048s
  End? 1025MB
  quit
  
  #udevadm settle (To update to kernel that we have done some update to partition).


point- single line how to create parttion.
# parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary xfs 2048s 100MB  


Note: ONce partition created then go for File System.
#mkfs.ext4  d /dev/sdb1

Once Partititon done then mount to a system.

#mkdir /mp 
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mp   (Temp mounting).


Persistent mounting :-
blkid /dev/sdb1 

# vim /etc/fstab 

UUID-value     /mp   FS-type  defaults dump_freqency  FSCK.
											0	0
											
# systectl daemon-reload
# lsblk
