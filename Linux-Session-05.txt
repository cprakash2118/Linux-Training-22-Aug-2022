- Disk/File-System Management.

#Resources:-
  CPU
  Memeory 
  IO devices (Disk/Storage part).

# Listing disk on server.
Old/Lagacy interface to manage disk on your servers - /usr/sbin/fdisk or /usr/sbin/gdisk etc 
New interface to manage disk on your servers - /usr/sbin/parted 
Basic commands for storage.
# lsblk  or lsblk -fp
# blkid <device_name_path> 
  Eg:- blkid /dev/sda1 
  
# parted print /dev/sda 


# Parttition, File System. and persistent mount points.
 As per parttition schemes:-
1) MBR parttition schemes.
2) GPT per parttition schemes.


1) MBR partition schemes:- 
 Point-1.  As per MBR partition schemes maximum primary partitions can be create is 4.
 Note: After 4 primary partitions, no partition can be created.
 
 POint-2. As per point1 - if less than 4 (3 Primary & 1 Extended partition and Under extended partition only you can create Logical partition).
 
 Point-3. Maximim  partitions can be 15.
          3 - Primary partitions 
		  1 - Extended parttion (All the remaining/required storage can be used by extended partition, so that when extended partiton create then under that logical partitions created and partitions count can be reached upto 15th.
		  
  Point-4. MBR support maximum partition size is 2TiB

  Point-5. 1st 512 bytes for MBR called boot loader (GRub2).
   NOte: GRand Unified Bootload version 2.
   What is bootloader - Boootloader is a source code responsible to start OS.
   
 HOw to manage the partition using parted commands (/usr/sbin/parted).
 
 parted print 
 # parted -l 
 # parted /dev/sdb print  
 # parted /dev/sdb 
 
 
 /dev/sdb (Taking example for this.
 
  # parted /dev/sdb 
  (parted) "print" then press Enter key  
  
Directly creating parttions.
  
  # parted /dev/sdb mklabel msdos   (MBR)
  # parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt     (GPT)
  
  # parted /dev/sdb 
  (parted) "mkpart" then 'Enter' key.
  Partition type? Primary/extended ? "primary" and then 'Enter' key .
  FIle system type? [ext2]
  "print"
  Start? 2048s
  End? 1025MB
  quit
  
  #udevadm settle (To update to kernel that we have done some update to partition).


point- single line how to create parttion.
# parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary xfs 2048s 100MB  


Note: ONce partition created then go for File System.
#mkfs.ext4   /dev/sdb1

Once Partititon done then mount to a system.

#mkdir /mp 
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mp   (Temp mounting).


Persistent mounting :-
blkid /dev/sdb1 

# vim /etc/fstab 

UUID-value     /mp   FS-type  defaults dump_freqency  FSCK.
											0	0
											
# systemctl daemon-reload
# lsblk

lab 
- Attach 2 GB/GIB and 3 GB/GIB are attached.
- over 2GB/GIB of disk make 4 primary partiition, each parttion 400MiB.
- Over 3GB of disk make 3 Primary of 100MIB each and 8 logical partition 100MiB (each).
- make ext4 FS to all primary partition respective to (/sda_mp1 , /sda_mp2, /sda_mp3 and /sda_m4, /sdb_m5, /sdb6_mp6
  /dev/sdb_mp7
- Makr ext2 to all logical  partition. 

Solution#
Disk 2GiB and 3Gib has been added to server.

Verify disks 

# parted -l | grep "Disk /dev/sd"
/dev/sda   2GiB
/dev/sdb   3GiB


# parted /dev/sda 
  (parted) "mklabel" then 'Enter' key.

===========================

##Step1) We have created Linux partition via "parted" command.
Eg: Disk name - /dev/sdc 

/dev/sdc1 (2048MB)  +  /dev/sdc2 (1024MB)     - Linux partition.


##Step 2) Physical Volume creation from Linux partition using below method.

# pvcreate /dev/sdc1  /dev/sdc2 
# pcs
# pvscan 
# pvdisplay 


##Step 3) Creating Volume Group (VG) using Physical Volume.

# vgcreate -n vg_name /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2 
# vgscan 
# vgs
# vgdisplay  


NOte: ***
- VG must be define the sixe of single "PE" 
- SIngle PE size always in 2^i (i=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 etc).

 posibilities = 4 , 8 , 16, 32, 64 
 
 
 
 Total Size = 4096 =(4GB)
 Single size of PE is 64MB 
 
 no of PE = 4096 / 64 
 
##Step 4) Create LVM (Logical VOlume Manager) from previous VOlume group.
 
 # lvcreate -l +400 -n lvm_name vg_name 
 # lvs 
 # lvscan 
 # lvdisplay 
 

## Step 5) Make file system and mount.
#mkfs.ext4 <LVM_PATH> 
#mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_name/lv_name 

# blkid  /dev/vg_name/lv_name 

# vim /etc/fstab 
<BLKID of LVM>   <MOunt_Point>  <FileSystem>  <Option> <fsck> <dump_freq>
UUID="skjdfhkjsd"   /opt/IBM    ext4     defaults 0 0 

:wq


# mkdir /opt/IBM 

# mount -a 

# df -THP 

===========
LVM extend 

# lvextend -l +50 /dev/vg_name/lv_name 
# resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name
# df -THP 

NOte: Size of the LVM will be extended.
